**Introduction **
This crime mapping analysis serves to help the DC Metropolitan Police Department determine which new areas the expanded gunshot detection should cover. In analyzing gun crimes reported  with gun shots audibly detected by Shotspotter sensors , we can see which wards would benefit the most from a gunshot detection network. 

**Analysis:Data**
The data used in this analysis is from the District of Columbia’s open data portal (https://opendata.dc.gov/). The crime data has locations and attributes of the incidents reported by the police. A few examples of these attributes include the method of the incident and the time of day the incidents occurred. For further information, see the link below. The ward dataset are polygons that show the boundaries of the DC 2012 election wards with attribute information from the census as well as the name of the ward’s repsentative. In this study, ‘POP_2010’ was used to calculate the number of gun crimes committed per 10,000 people. Finally, the Shotspotter data includes the point locations of possible gunshots detected by sound sensors. This data may include errors such as gun shots that occurred in a neighboring ward but could be heard by sensors in one of the wards in this study.
